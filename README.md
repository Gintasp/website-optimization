This is my first try optimizing a website for speed. Screenshots of Google Page Speed Insights and Chrome Developer Tools' Performance tests before and after the optimization are available in this repo under the names of "before-optimization.jpg" and "after-optimization.jpg". Sample website is available online at  https://gintasp.github.io/website-optimization/
=================================================================

Website Performance Stats:

***BEFORE:***
Render Range 0-975ms,
Page Speed Insights 71(Mobile) & 29(Desktop).

***AFTER:***
Render Range 0-586ms,
Page Speed Insights 99(Mobile) & 97(Desktop).

Steps I've taken:
1. Optimized Critical Rendering Path.
2. Minified CSS files.
3. Minified JS files and got rid of dead code.
4. Used "async" attribute on one of the blocking scipts.
5. Used "media" atribute for printing, thus unblocked CSS file.
6. Compressed images, converted larger ones to .webp format.
7. Reduced the amount of white space in html files.

Things I learned doing this project:
1. Gained significant amount of new skills using Chrome Developer Tools.
2. Attained skills for website optimization.
3. Learned about browsers and how they render pages.
4. Deepened my knowledge about DOM, CSSOM and Render Tree.
6. Learned about Critical Rendering Path and best practices to optimize it.
7. Discovered what is blocking the rendering process.


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
